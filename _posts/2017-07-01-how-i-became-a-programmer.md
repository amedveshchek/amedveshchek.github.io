### About childhood (*excerpt from attendee notes*)

... 

*Alex*: Hello, my name is Alex, and I am a programmer.

*Doctor*: Let's support Alex together.<br/>
*(sound of applause)*

*Alex*: To be honest, I'm not always been a programmer. True. I even was not born with hands embedded in the keyboard *(the approving nod of attendees)*.

For example, there was a time when I was an ordinary child of five years... Although there was a time when I was even less! *(good and naive smiles went on their faces)*. But once... *(sighed)* Once, when I was five, my mother bought me a toy truck with a clockwork mechanism. The first time I played with it as a normal child, without ulterior motives, but then I wondered how it's made, how it works... Well, you know. I took my favorite screwdriver and disassembled it in five minutes. I did it before and didn’t suspect what it could lead to... And when I pulled out the last gear wheel and metal spring from the clockwork mechanism... Well, you know, that one, all in machine oil, which is very elastic... *(sighed again)* at that moment my mother came in and said that since I broke the truck, she wouldn’t buy toys anymore... Well, what could I do? *(biting his lip)* I could not restrain myself and assembled it back, and unfortunately it worked!..<br/>
*(the attendees lowered their eyes, the doctor folded his arms and looked at the floor somewhere)*

*Alex*: And when mom saw that the truck was working, she was surprised and at other times bought me toys again, which of course led to... You know... *(through tears, with lower voice)* I began to assemble new toys from their parts *(the doctor closed his eyes tightly)*. So... That's how... I became an addict to engineering...<br/>
*(lowered his eyes, slowly sat on his chair; silence)*

*Doctor (as if having come to his senses)*: Let's support Alex.<br/>
*(sound of inconfident applause)* ...

### About teenage years (~14 y.o.)

Once in the late spring I came to visit my childhood friend. He and his brother did a rather unusual thing: my friend was dictating some English words from a book, and his brother was pressing the buttons of the black box with the **ZX Spectrum** sticker. In response, letters appeared on the small TV, lining up the list.

-- What are you doing, guys?<br/>
-- We're programming the game! It remains quite a bit to finish. -- answered Sanya.<br/>

None of us understood what Sanya dictated and what his brother typed on keyboard. We just wanted to play.<br/>
After 10 minutes they finished, his brother typed **RUN** on the keyboard, pressed **Enter** and the inscription **SOKOBAN** appeared on the screen. The game has begun!

Not to say I've never seen a computer before that time. I had an 8-bit game console, like Dendy, so computer games were a very familiar and favorite hobby for me. However, I never thought about what was behind all this.<br/>
The guys started to play, and I picked up a book and started flipping through it, looking through the listings of game programs.

Looking at the programs, it seems that every word is familiar, there weren't any incomprehensible squiggles, despite I was Russian guy and had only basic knowledge of school-English. Very bad English (now the same, but a bit better :smile:).

In 30 minutes the guys played a lot, and I suggested to write another game -- “Guess The Number” -- one player thinks and types a number on the keyboard, then it is erased by program from the screen. Then the other player guesses it at the prompts of the program suggest the direction of guess: more or less. Turned out, it was very easy.

It intrigued me to change the program a little and make it possible to guess TWO numbers at the same time. Super easy!

Well, it was the first taste of programming.

I felt even more taste when later, without any prompting, books or programming experience, I realized how graphic sprites were formed in the **SOKOBAN** game. These were simple binary codes where every bit was responsible for a pixel! It was ecstasy! I could draw anything! It was enough to draw an 8x8 matrix on a piece of paper and count 8 byte numbers for each row and it turned to a new image of the hero of the game or a piece of the wall!

From now on, I began to visit my friend to test my programs, which I thought up at home and wrote down in a notebook. Not a laptop, just a notebook, using a pencil! `=)` This continued until my father bought me my own old ZX Spectrum for some pennies. But what it was a surprise! I had my own computer with embedded BASIC language -- I could to program any time I wanted! I was totally happy.

The journey into programming world has begun...
